# Create CEP Extension

A near zero config approach to creating CEP extensions with Webpack and React.

## Installation

It's recommended to download and start from the [example project](https://github.com/fusepilot/create-cep-extension-example). If you do, skip to the usage section below.

````yarn add -D create-cep-extension````

Then add these scripts to your package.json.

````json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node ./node_modules/create-cep-extension/scripts/start.js",
  "build": "node ./node_modules/create-cep-extension/scripts/build.js",
  "bin": "node ./node_modules/create-cep-extension/scripts/bin.js"
}
````

Then finally add a ````.env```` file with your extension's configuration.

````bash
EXTENSION_NAME="My Extension"
EXTENSION_BUNDLE_ID="com.mycompany.myextension"
EXTENSION_CERTIFICATE_COUNTRY="US"
EXTENSION_CERTIFICATE_PROVINCE="CA"
EXTENSION_CERTIFICATE_ORG="MyCompany"
EXTENSION_CERTIFICATE_NAME="com.mycompany"
EXTENSION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD="mypassword"
EXTENSION_CERTIFICATE="certificate.p12"
````

### Target Hosts

By default, the extension will target all known versions of all Adobe hosts. To target specific hosts, add a `EXTENSION_HOST_IDS` variable to your `.env` with a comma delimited list of the host id's you want to target.

For example, to target just In Design and After Effects, you would add this to your `.env` file:

````bash
EXTENSION_HOST_IDS="IDSN, AEFT"
````

If you want to target specific versions of specific host IDs, you can add a JSON object of `EXTENSION_HOST_IDS_AND_VERSIONS` to your `.env` file:

```bash
EXTENSION_HOST_IDS_AND_VERSIONS='{ "IDSN": "[11.0,99.9]", "ILST": "[19.2.1,99.9]" }'
```

## Usage

### Before you start…

Before running the start script for the first time, you’ll need to enable unsigned extensions so the hot reloading frame for your extension will work. To do this, run:

```
defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.8 PlayerDebugMode 1
```

…replacing `8` with the `CEP` version you’re targeting.

### Development

````yarn run start````

The extension will now be accesible from the target application's extensions menu. You will also be able to view the extension in a browser window, usually from [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you make a change, the window will reload (most of the time).

### Building

````yarn run build````

The extension will be built into the build directory.

### Packaging

````yarn run bin````

The build directory will be packaged into a ````.zxp```` in the bin directory.



## Communicating with Extendscript

There are two helper methods that you can import and use to ease Extendscript communication.

### `loadExtendscript(extendScriptFileName: string): Promise`

Loads and evaluates the specified file in the src/extendscript directory. Returns a promise with the result.

````javascript
loadExtendscript('index.jsx')
````

### `evalExtendscript(code: string): Promise`

Evaluates the specified code. Returns a Promise.

````javascript
evalExtendscript('writeLn("Hello Foo");') // writes "Hello Foo" to the info panel
````

If you return a JSON string using [json2](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) or similar from Extendscript, you can get the parsed result.

````javascript
evalExtendscript('JSON.stringifiy({foo: "bar"});')
  .then(result => console.log(result)) // prints {foo: "bar"}
  .catch(error => console.warn(error))
````

## Other helper methods

### `openURLInDefaultBrowser(url: string)`

Opens the url in the default browser. Will also work when viewing outside the target application in a browser.

## Troubleshooting

If you get errors when running ````yarn run bin````, you probably need to build first, ````yarn run build````.



## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request



## Todo

* Create boilerplate script.
* Script to initially create ````certificate.p12````. Still need to do that part manually up front right now.
* Create ````.jsxbin````'s automatically and smoothly. Adobe has made this nearly impossible to do on macOS, so not sure if its worth the trouble. Especially since .jsxbin doesn't really deter hackers.
